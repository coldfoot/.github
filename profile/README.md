👋 About Us

We are a loose collective of designers, data journalists, and developers who come together to create socially relevant (and multiple award-winning!) projects — often experimental, always committed. While we’re not a formal organization, we’ve collaborated over the years with partners such as:

	* Google News Initiative
	* The Washington Post
	* Agência Lupa
	* Foro de Periodismo Argentino (FOPEA)
	* Instituto Prensa y Sociedad Venezuela (IPYS)
	* Cátedra Josué de Castro, University of São Paulo

Our work touches on urgent issues like Covid-19, news deserts in Latin America, and hunger in Brazil. We use data, design, and storytelling to make complex realities visible — and hopefully, actionable.

🌱 What We Believe

	* Technology should serve people, not the other way around
	* Good design is inclusive and intentional
	* Stories are powerful tools for change
	* Collaboration beats competition

🛠️ What We Do

	* Interactive maps and dashboards
	* Data analysis and visualization
	* Narrative-driven data stories
